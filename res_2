This script evaluates the performance of the custom heuristic function by
comparing the strength of an agent using iterative deepening (ID) search with
alpha-beta pruning against the strength rating of agents using other heuristic
functions.  The `ID_Improved` agent provides a baseline by measuring the
performance of a basic agent using Iterative Deepening and the "improved"
heuristic (from lecture) on your hardware.  The `Student` agent then measures
the performance of Iterative Deepening and the custom heuristic against the
same opponents.

  Match 1: ID_Improved vs   Random    /Users/zouyu/PycharmProjects/Isolation-Project/tournament.py:121: UserWarning: One or more agents lost a match this round due to timeout. The get_move() function must return before time_left() reaches 0 ms. You will need to leave some time for the function to return, and may need to increase this margin to avoid timeouts during  tournament play.
